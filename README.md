# Python Basics Practice - Beginner Exercises

## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts I created while practicing the fundamental concepts of Python programming. These exercises focus on reinforcing core programming skills through basic syntax and logic.

## Topics Covered

- **Variables and Data Types**
- **Operators**
- **Input and Output**
- **Control Flow** (if-else statements)
- **Loops** (for, while)
- **Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries**
- **Functions**
- **Basic File Handling**

## Usage

- Each script is self-contained and focuses on a specific Python concept.
- You can modify the scripts or add your own practice exercises.
